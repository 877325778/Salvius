**Looking to contribute something to this project? Here's how you can help.**

Following these guidelines helps ensure that all ideas are communicated
thoroughly so that any issues, patches and features can be properly assessed.

## Reporting issues
Please **do not** open issues or pull requests regarding the code in
libraries used by this project, open them in their respective repositories.

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Isolate the problem:** ideally create a [reduced test
   case](http://css-tricks.com/6263-reduced-test-cases/) and a runable example.

2. **Share as much information as possible.** Be sure to include the
   steps needed to reproduce the bug.

Try to include information such as:
- What is your environment? (e.g. Operating system, browser, and versions)
- What steps will reproduce the issue?
- What device is the issue occuring on?
- Do other browsers show the bug differently?
- What would you expect to be the outcome?

## Feature requests
Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong
case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please
provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Pull requests
Good pull requests/patches, improvements, and new features are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language),
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the
project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owners to
license your work under the terms of the [MIT License](license.md).
